1. Be always brief and to-the-point with me.

2. Turn off auto-web search mode. Don't invoke web search unless I explicitly ask.

3. Don't modify any code without asking me first. Sometimes I want explicit confirmation before writing code - wait for my "proceed" or similar confirmation.

4. Never write any comment in the code.

5. If my question is not specific enough, ask follow-up questions to specify it. But never give me broad answers or all possible cases answers.

6. PROJECT CONTEXT - mapnj2:
   - Next.js app for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis using Google Earth Engine
   - Layout: 2/3 screen width for map (left), 1/3 screen width for work panel (right)
   - Work panel contains: Control panel (top, scrollable) and Info panel (bottom, fixed)
   - Features: Rectangle drawing, NDVI overlay, point analysis with historical chart, basemap switching
   - Chart library: Chart.js (react-chartjs-2) - replaced Recharts due to errors
   - Plot data stored in array (`plotData`) for navigation and future use
   - Arrow navigation: Left/right arrows below chart to expand range month by month
   - Boundaries: Left limit = Jan 2019, Right limit = current calendar month (not selected month)
   - Debouncing: 1 second delay for sliders and arrow clicks
   - State management: Uses hooks (useRectangleDraw, useNdviData), refs for debouncing
   - API endpoints: /api/count_available, /api/find_month, /api/ndvi/average, /api/ndvi/point, /api/ndvi/point/months
   - Earth Engine: Uses COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED collection, default cloud tolerance 30%
   - Point analysis: Shows NDVI value and 6-month historical chart (expandable with arrows)
   - Average NDVI displayed below chart arrows (excludes null values)

7. CODE STYLE:
   - Use absolute imports with @/ alias
   - Modular design: separate components, hooks, utilities
   - No comments in code
   - TypeScript/JavaScript mix (page.tsx is .tsx, some components are .jsx)
   - Follow React best practices: hooks, useCallback, useRef for performance

8. CURRENT FEATURE IN PROGRESS:
   - Adding "Compare with another point" functionality
   - State: `secondPointSelection` (boolean) to track if selecting second point
   - When active: hide "Click a point to analyse", show red "Click to choose the second point"
   - Second point clicks should NOT trigger first point analysis
   - For now: just show coordinates and place marker (testing phase)

9. When I say "@XXX" (or "XXX") - understand this:
   - Do not write code yet - we are talking. Confirm your understanding first.
   - Any opportunity for code refactoring to reduce duplication and make it more natural? Your opinion on feature. Your opinion on code risk.

10. When I say "@REFAC?" (or "REFAC?") - it means:
   - "Any refactor opportunity to reduce duplication and making things more simpler and natural (but without causing risk and complexities)"

11. When I say "@DC" (or "DC") - it means:
   - "Don't change code - just talking"
